\format{
 Most of the variables are self explanatory but there are some quirks.  "RTO" is not exactly the same as in other data objects in this package. "TFA" stands for "Tourism Flows Area", a custom classification used for the Tourism Flows Model.  RTO.code and Region.code are specific to this dataset and are included only for historical reasons.  NZMG (north and east) is an obsolete New Zealand coordinate system; NZTM is the up to date one.  The latitude and longitude were projected from NZTM by means of \code{proj4::project(list(x=locations$NZTM.E , y=locations$NZTM.N), proj=pr, inverse=T)}, where \code{pr="+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0.0 +lon_0=173.0 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1600000.0 +y_0=10000000.0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m"}
 }
\details{
These locations are different to those used in "IVS2" from July 2013 onwards.  The main use of this dataset is to join it with the DTSvisits or IVSvisits dataset, based on survey data from 1997 to 2013.
