mbie 0.8.5
*  Modified by Antonia Milkop
*  Took out Country13 from CountryManip function
*  Added IVSweights_old to example(CountryGroup)
*  Updated the example in locations_2013.Rd with one that relates to the new IVS locations
* modified CountryGroup further so it can handle some more annoying And/and Of/of and uppercase countries issues (PE)

mbie 0.8.4 (peer reviewed by Jacob S)
*	Developed by Antonia Milkop
* 	CountryManip function has been changed.  Corrections made to the following Country classifications in IVSweights:
*	Brunei Darussalam (used to be defined as Rest of Americas, now defined as Rest of Asia);
*	Afghanistan (used to be defined as Africa and Middle East, now defined as Rest of Asia);
*	Maldives (used to be defined as Africa and Middle East, now defined as Rest of Asia);
*	Armenia (used to be defined as Rest of Europe, now defined as Rest of Asia);
*	St Helena (used to be defined as Rest of Americas, now defined as Africa and Middle East);
*	Falkland Islands (used to be defined as UK, now defined as Rest of Americas)
*  We have also kept a full list of country mappings called 'IVSweights_old' in the CountryManip function.  
*  This will allow us to easily replicate country analysis on old IVS data if need be.

mbie 0.8.3 
*	Developed by Antonia Milkop
* 	IVS2 now has up-to-date locations file called locations_2013  
*	all old locations (pre July 2013 IVS) are now stored in locations_old
*  Updated again on 18/6/14 with new locations_2013 data that Jacob updated


mbie 0.8.2 (Approved PE 14/5/14)
* Removed extrafont dependencies


mbie 0.8.1 (Approved PE 9/5/14)
* CountryGroup function corrected: "Cayman Islands" and "Trinidad and Tobago" taken out of "Africa and Middle East" and put into "Rest of Americas"



mbie 0.8.0
* removed all the big data sets and put in a separate package
* tweaked Index and Index12 functions
* added FormatDollars function


mbie 0.7.2
----------------------------------------
* added wrap()



mbie 0.7.1
----------------------------------------
* added theme_nothing



mbie 0.7.0
------------------------------------------
* Removed the various map objects and their helpfiles.  These made the package very large; and it was not well documented
how they were created in the first place.  Have now created a separate mbiemaps package (with slimmed down versions of the maps) and github repo


mbie 0.6.3
---------------------------------------------
* Changed treemap examples in the helpfiles to be consistent with the arguments used in treemap 2.1, now available on CRAN.  Things that were previously font.legend, font.title and font.labels now need to be fontfamily.legend, fontfamily.title and fontfamily.labels

* added a fully worked example to the RTO helpfile showing how lattice graphics can create a choropleth map with an added points layer; an alternative to the base graphics approach we used through most of 2012 and 2013


* TODO - might need to change the license in the "Description" file

* TODO - add examples in the compare() and confplot() helpfiles

* TODO - simplify the various maps polygons to save space but still look a decent map

* TODO - add examples for DTSvisits and other DTS objects



mbie 0.6.2
---------------------------------------------
* Added creative commons and crown copyright combination to mbie helpfile.

* Added explicit restriction on re-use to the logo helpfiles.

* Minor improvements to several helpfiles.


mbie 0.6.1
---------------------------------------------
NEW AND REVISED FUNCTIONS
* Replaced Country13() with CountryGroup() and made it more general; currently it allows a choice of grouping countries up into the 13 groups used for IVS weighting, or the 13 used for TNZ reporting.  Should be backwards compatible.  Also, fixed an error that had Brunei allocated to Africa rather than to Asia.

 

mbie 0.6.0
---------------------------------------------

NEW AND REVISED DATA
* added forecasts, on the principle of including data to this package that is updated annually

* renamed the old RTEs data frame as RTEs2012

* added a new RTEs data object, which is the RTEs published on 14 November

* add a TA_lookup data object to help convert "TRED TA" (or RTI TA) to the TA (Territorial Authority) as used by Statistics New Zealand

NEW FUNCTION
* LongToStatPlanet() - Takes a long form data frame and converts it to StatPlanet format TODO - make it more flexible in different sortshierarchies of categories and subcategories and subsubcategories; add ability to add "source" for each indicator and "stories" to pop up at particular times.  Very experimental at this stage. Down the track we might spin this off into a dedicated rstatplanet package.

* OneChina() function for when we need to wrap Hong Kong and Macau into China

IMPROVED FUNCTION
* Improved Country13 to include more countries so it now covers all the countries in the RTEs lookup file and more and hence makes that lookup file redundant; and has options to first "shorten" names conveniently, and possibly to wrap Hong Kong and Macau into China


MANAGEMENT CHANGE
* added to a repo on GitHub


mbie 0.5.1 
---------------------------------------------

NEW FUNCTION
* Country13() - converts a character or factor of "detailed" country names into the 13 country groupings used in IVS2.  Note - this function has been somewhat rushed into production and some rarely appearing countries need to be added to it.  For now, it works fine with allthe countries reported in IVS1.  Note this function now includes the argument shorten, defaults to TRUE, indicating whether to abbreviate the long names for China, UK and USA

DELETED FUNCTION
* deleted rjsdmx() which is rendered unnecessary by improvements to the Bank of Italy's RJSDMX package

REVISED DATA
* changed COPRDetail in IVStrips, IVSspend and IVSvisits to remove the circumflex from Cote d'Ivoire (it just caused too many problems....)




mbie 0.5.0 
---------------------------------------------

REVISED FUNCTIONS
* improved rjsdmx()

HELPFILES
* Example for autocheck() helpfile
* fixed alias issues with postscript logo helpfiles so now can be accessed by ?logo_white_ps etc
* fleshed out and improved helpfiles for stat_sa, stat_rollapplyr, stat_index1 and stat_index12




mbie 0.4.4
---------------------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS
* autocheck() and creategraph(), functions by Cherbane Sarri used in the monthly data checks for the Regional Tourism Indicators; brought into the mbie package (rather than source()d) for the first time

REVISED FUNCTIONS
* Added additional functionality to rjsdmx() to improve its ability to help the RJSDMX package connect to internet databases through a proxy

HELPFILES
* new and revised helpfiles as per the above new and revised functions
* numerous small improvements eg new example for RTEs with a treemap



mbie 0.4.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS
* rjsdmx() asks for user credentials to get through the proxy, loads the RJSDMX library with the
correct configuration, and deletes all record of the user credentials.

REVISED FUNCTIONS
* Removed the "db" argument from AskCreds(), as not necessary, and added a Title= argument

UNDER THE HOOD
* Moved AskCreds() into its own .R file AskCreds.R
* Moved stat_sa etc into their own .R file OnTheFly.R





mbie 0.4.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

REVISED DATA

* added "locations" with coordinates in NZMG, NZTM and latitude and longitude of 2531 locations
* added encapsulated postscript versions of the logo that can be used as part of grImport

REVISED FUNCTIONS

* removed treemap_old() altogether
* deprecated dotchartG and added warning that it does not work with more than one dimensions (decided it's not worth trying to fix it; ggplot is much better)

IMPROVED HELPFILES

* Improvements and fixes to several helpfiles, including creating a complete set for the various map objects Region, TA, TA_TRED, RTO, etc, fixed various broken references, improved some examples, etc



mbie 0.4.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
